    sales, marketing, or partnerships before — or at least you've written a lot of cold emails
    that actually got replies. You understand tone. You're comfortable switching between formal
    and casual depending on the brand's vibe. You're curious, organized, and results-driven.
    And most importantly, you care about connecting with people — even in just a few lines of text.
